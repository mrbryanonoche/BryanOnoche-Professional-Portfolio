# 💳 PCI-DSS Compliance Readiness – Microsoft Cloud Security Implementation

## 🔍 Overview
This project simulates a PCI-DSS readiness and remediation initiative for a cloud-first company handling payment card data. It focuses on applying Microsoft 365 and Azure tools to meet PCI-DSS v4.0 technical control objectives.

---

## 🛡️ Project Scope
- Identify applicable PCI-DSS requirements (Requirements 3, 7, 10, 11)
- Map Microsoft Sentinel, Intune, Defender, and Azure AD to control objectives
- Implement technical safeguards and demonstrate evidence capture
- Mock a PCI DSS self-assessment and remediation plan

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM log collection + monitoring)
- Azure Active Directory (MFA, access controls)
- Microsoft Intune (device compliance + encryption)
- Microsoft Purview (DLP, data classification)
- Azure Log Analytics, KQL queries
