<h1>The Digital Alchemist<br/></h1>
<b>A powerhouse blend of IT mastermind, cybersecurity sentinel, and Agile commander, I am the go-to force for turning chaos into clean architecture. With 20+ years of tech leadership, credentials (PMP, CSM, Six Sigma, MBA), and hands-on chops in managing and executing projects in cloud infrastructure, Microsoft Intune, Sentinel & Endpoint, DevSecOps, EDI, and M365 governance, etc. I don't just manage projects, I engineer enterprise evolution.
  From Zero Trust blueprints to Scrum team revivals, from Azure AD mergers to Salesforce CRM in secure Teams environments, I lead like a tactician, deliver like a visionary, and rewrite the rules like a startup founder. However, I abide by a strict professional and ethical code of conduct, and we must always strive to question everything, tweak until it is perfect, and make sure the impact is measurable. I am equal parts builder, protector, and strategist with a DIY streak and business brain to match.</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/Bryan Onoche/"></a></b>
