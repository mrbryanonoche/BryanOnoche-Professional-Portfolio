# 🚀 Agile EDI Implementation for Regulatory Compliance

## 🔍 Overview
This project showcases my leadership in implementing an **Agile-based Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)** system integration for a manufacturing environment subject to regulatory oversight. I introduced Scrum practices, coached business and IT teams, and delivered a compliance-ready solution that reduced manual data exchange inefficiencies.

## 👤 My Role
**Scrum Master / Agile Delivery Lead**  
I introduced Agile frameworks to a traditional waterfall environment, aligned development with regulatory needs (e.g. SOX, HIPAA), and drove incremental delivery using Jira and backlog prioritization.
