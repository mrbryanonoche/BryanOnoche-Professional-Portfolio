# 🏥 HIPAA-Compliant Security Controls for Microsoft Cloud Environments

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates how I implemented HIPAA-aligned security and privacy controls in a Microsoft 365 cloud environment for a healthcare startup. The goal was to ensure that Protected Health Information (PHI) was properly secured across user endpoints, communication tools, and cloud resources.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Establish technical safeguards for PHI in Microsoft 365
- Enable secure communication via Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint
- Apply auditing, data loss prevention (DLP), and access controls
- Prepare cloud environment for HIPAA compliance audit

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft 365 Compliance Center**
- **Microsoft Purview DLP**
- **Azure AD (RBAC, Conditional Access)**
- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**
- **Audit Logs + eDiscovery**

## 🚀 Implementation Highlights

1. **Access Controls & RBAC**
   - Created least privilege roles in Azure AD
   - Restricted admin permissions across Exchange, SharePoint, Teams

2. **DLP Policies**
   - Created sensitive info types (e.g. SSN, MRN, ICD-10)
   - Blocked external sharing and auto-encrypted emails with PHI

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Enabled Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Logs
   - Implemented eDiscovery cases for incident review

4. **Security Configurations**
   - Enforced MFA and passwordless authentication
   - Configured Defender for Office to block phishing & malware
